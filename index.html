        <h1>Babel Between Us</h1>
        <p>
            Babel Between Us is a literary experiment where 18 writers and 9 ethnographers from all over the world, over the course
            of two years, wrote collaboratively. The project resulted in a cartographic visualization of a collaboratively created
            world, exploring the uncharted waters between collaboration, fiction, and ethnography.
            
            Our aim was to explore if a collaborative writing process could be aided by a digital ethnography made on the writing as
            it happened. The writers wrote on a forum, the ethnographers analyzed the writing as they happened, and fed this back to
            the writers, creating a feedback loop between the creative output and the analysis of it. We wanted to know how this
            affected the collaborative process, if it made it easier to get a grasp of the direction of the group, and if it opened
            new interesting entry points for the creative process.</p>

            The analysis was done through ethnographic coding, which essentially is adding labels to
            parts of the text of reocurring meaning. These labels are then extracted and used to build a
            conceptual map of the fiction, by grouping together concepts that often co-occur. For
            example, the ethnographic code “boundlessness” has often been applied to gether with codes
            such as “darkness” and “emptiness”.

                The absolvement or lack of boundaries. As in explicitly pointing out that the ocean is endless, or that a tower is so
                tall no one knows how many floors there are.

                'boundlessness' has often been applied together with meticulous categorisation, darkness, emptiness,
                death, limits of one's consciousness, accepting death, the university, bottleneck, pandemic, indifference,
                self-reflection, the city, recurring dream, dream-like quality and staircase

            The writing started in March 2020, just as the world went into lockdown. The writers contributed from their different
            corners of the world into what became a sort of remotely conducted Decamerone, weaving their real experiences of the
            pandemic with dreams of escapes to other worlds.

            As lockdowns succeeded one another we continued writing and analyzing, adding and removing rules of the game. The
            writers got the option to lock threads, to fork threads, and we arranged monthly video calls to discuss the evolution of
            the corpus. Fights occurred, friendships were formed, and a lot of interesting text was written.

                a dating app. They had both moved there after some horrible incident in their home lands which they were both trying
                to avoid thinking about.

            <i>Some thoughts on ethnography of fiction, with some references to precedents.</i><br><br>

            An ongoing conversation throughout the project was of course the core question of how to do an ethnography of fiction?
            All labels attached should carry some sort of abstracted meaning from the text, but who decides what constitute meaning?<br><br>

            <i>Some thoughts on making a large scale remote creative project like this</i><br><br>
            
            <i>Some learnings - but not too many</i><br><br>

            We hope this project will inspire other similar explorations. All the technology developed is open source. If you are
            interested in doing something similar, please do reach out to us!
